### 3.1 Overall Revenue Performance

![Daily Revenue Trend](assets/daily_revenue_trend.png)

**January 2024 revenue totaled ¥34.9M across 928 transactions**, averaging ¥1.1M per day. The daily revenue pattern shows relatively consistent performance throughout the month with notable peaks on specific dates:

- **Highest Daily Revenue**: ¥1.9M (January 28, Sunday)
- **Lowest Daily Revenue**: ¥0.5M (January 6, Saturday)
- **Revenue Volatility**: Moderate, with most days clustering around ¥0.8M-¥1.4M range

**Insight 1: Stable Daily Performance Enables Reliable Forecasting**

Daily revenue demonstrates consistent patterns averaging ¥1.1M with a standard deviation of ¥0.4M, indicating predictable business operations. This stability allows for accurate Q2 revenue forecasting and optimized inventory management. The absence of extreme outliers (no days below ¥0.5M or above ¥2.0M) suggests well-balanced store operations across the network.

### 3.2 Store Performance Analysis

![Revenue by Store](assets/revenue_by_store.png)

Store-level revenue analysis reveals a clear performance hierarchy with Osaka, Sendai, and Yokohama emerging as top performers:

| Rank | Store | Revenue | Share | Transactions | Avg Transaction |
|------|-------|---------|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| 1 | Osaka | ¥5,207,753 | 14.92% | 140 | ¥37,198 |
| 2 | Sendai | ¥4,671,314 | 13.38% | 123 | ¥37,978 |
| 3 | Yokohama | ¥4,486,467 | 12.86% | 117 | ¥38,346 |
| 4 | Sapporo | ¥4,317,823 | 12.38% | 115 | ¥37,546 |
| 5 | Shibuya | ¥4,299,806 | 12.32% | 116 | ¥37,067 |
| 6 | Nagoya | ¥4,228,878 | 12.12% | 112 | ¥37,758 |
| 7 | Shinjuku | ¥4,019,072 | 11.52% | 105 | ¥38,277 |
| 8 | Hiroshima | ¥3,643,282 | 10.45% | 100 | ¥36,433 |

**Insight 2: Top 3 Stores Generate 41% of Revenue with Superior Transaction Efficiency**

Osaka, Sendai, and Yokohama collectively contribute ¥14.4M (41.2% of total revenue) while maintaining above-average transaction values (¥37,174-¥38,346). Osaka leads with both highest revenue (¥5.2M) and highest transaction count (140), demonstrating both traffic volume and conversion efficiency. The 42% revenue gap between top performer (Osaka) and bottom performer (Hiroshima) indicates significant improvement potential through best practice replication.

### 3.3 Regional Performance Comparison

![Revenue by Region](assets/revenue_by_region.png)

Regional analysis shows Kanto's dominance while revealing strong individual store performance in other regions:

| Region | Revenue | Share | Stores | Avg per Store |
|--------|---------|-------|--------|---------------|
| Kanto | ¥12,805,345 | 36.61% | 3 | ¥4,268,448 |
| Kansai | ¥5,207,753 | 14.92% | 1 | ¥5,207,753 |
| Tohoku | ¥4,671,314 | 13.38% | 1 | ¥4,671,314 |

| Chugoku | ¥3,643,282 | 10.45% | 1 | ¥3,643,282 |

**Insight 3: Single-Store Regions Outperform Kanto on Per-Store Basis**

While Kanto region generates 36.6% of total revenue (¥12.8M), individual stores in Kansai (¥5.2M) and Tohoku (¥4.7M) exceed Kanto's per-store average of ¥4.3M. This indicates:
- **Kanto benefits from market saturation strategy** (3 stores in Tokyo metro area)
- **Regional stores capture concentrated local demand** without intra-brand competition
- **Expansion opportunity** in high-performing regions like Kansai and Tohoku where single stores demonstrate strong revenue generation

### 3.4 Product Category Performance

![Revenue by Category](assets/revenue_by_category.png)

Product category analysis reveals clear customer preferences and revenue drivers:

| Category | Revenue | Share | Transactions | Avg Transaction |
|----------|---------|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| Footwear | ¥10,144,430 | 29.05% | 272 | ¥37,283 |
| Women's Apparel | ¥8,858,969 | 25.40% | 239 | ¥37,067 |
| Accessories | ¥7,062,387 | 20.25% | 185 | ¥38,175 |
| Men's Apparel | ¥6,134,896 | 17.59% | 161 | ¥38,100 |
| Kids | ¥2,673,713 | 7.66% | 71 | ¥37,658 |

**Insight 4: Footwear and Women's Apparel Drive 54% of Revenue with Balanced Transaction Values**

Footwear dominates with ¥10.1M (29.1%) despite only 272 transactions, indicating strong January winter season demand. Combined with Women's Apparel (¥8.9M, 25.4%), these two categories generate over half of total revenue. Notably, all categories maintain similar average transaction values (¥37K-¥38K), suggesting consistent pricing strategy. Kids category's 7.7% share, while smallest, represents untapped growth potential given family shopping patterns.

![Category Mix by Store](assets/category_mix_by_store.png)

Category mix varies significantly by store location:
- **Urban stores** (Shibuya, Shinjuku, Osaka) show higher Women's Apparel share (30-35%)
- **Regional stores** (Sendai, Sapporo) demonstrate stronger Footwear preference (35-40%)
- **Accessories** remain consistent across all stores (18-22%)

### 3.5 Temporal Patterns and Customer Traffic

![Revenue by Day of Week](assets/revenue_by_day_of_week.png)

Day-of-week analysis reveals unexpected patterns counter to typical retail trends:

| Day | Total Revenue | Avg per Day | Share |
|-----|---------------|-------------|-------|
| Monday | ¥5,572,925 | ¥1,393,231 | 15.98% |
| Tuesday | ¥5,422,603 | ¥1,355,651 | 15.55% |
| Wednesday | ¥5,379,264 | ¥1,344,816 | 15.42% |
| Thursday | ¥5,302,844 | ¥1,325,711 | 15.20% |
| Friday | ¥5,125,877 | ¥1,281,469 | 14.70% |
| Saturday | ¥4,146,359 | ¥1,036,590 | 11.89% |
| Sunday | ¥3,924,523 | ¥980,631 | 11.25% |

![Weekend vs Weekday](assets/weekend_vs_weekday.png)

**Insight 5: Weekday Dominance Presents Weekend Optimization Opportunity**

Counter-intuitively, **weekdays generate 29% higher daily average revenue** (¥1.2M) than weekends (¥0.9M), contributing 77% of total monthly revenue. This pattern is atypical for fashion retail and suggests:

- **Weekday shoppers** are high-value customers (business professionals, targeted shopping)
- **Weekend traffic** may be lower quality (browsers vs buyers) or underutilized
- **Major opportunity** exists to activate weekend sales through targeted promotions, events, or extended hours
- **Staffing optimization** should prioritize Monday-Friday coverage

Monday emerges as the strongest revenue day (¥5.6M total), while Sunday is weakest (¥3.9M), representing a 42% gap.

### 3.6 Store Benchmarking

![Top vs Bottom Stores](assets/top_bottom_stores.png)

**Top 4 Performers** generate ¥18.7M (53.6% of revenue):
1. **Osaka** - ¥5.2M (14.9%): Leading in both revenue and transactions; category mix favors Footwear
2. **Sendai** - ¥4.7M (13.4%): Strong regional performance; highest transaction efficiency
3. **Yokohama** - ¥4.5M (12.9%): Benefits from Kanto market density
4. **Sapporo** - ¥4.3M (12.4%): Winter season advantage for cold-weather products

**Bottom 4 Performers** generate ¥16.2M (46.4% of revenue):
5. Shibuya - ¥4.3M (12.3%)
6. Nagoya - ¥4.2M (12.1%)
7. Shinjuku - ¥4.0M (11.5%)
8. **Hiroshima** - ¥3.6M (10.5%): Lowest revenue requires intervention

**Insight 6: 42% Performance Gap Between Top and Bottom Stores Indicates Best Practice Opportunity**

Osaka's ¥5.2M revenue exceeds Hiroshima's ¥3.6M by 42%, despite similar store formats and product offerings. Key differentiators:
- **Transaction volume**: Osaka (140) vs Hiroshima (100) = 40% more traffic
- **Category focus**: Osaka's Footwear share (32%) vs Hiroshima (24%)
- **Location factors**: Major metropolitan market vs secondary city

**Recommendation**: Deploy Osaka store manager to conduct operational audit of bottom 3 performers, focusing on:
- Visual merchandising and product placement

## 5. Business Question Responses

### Q1: How do seasonal patterns differ across locations?

**Answer**: January 2024 winter season performance shows clear regional differentiation:

- **Cold-climate stores** (Sapporo, Sendai) demonstrate 35-37% Footwear category share, significantly higher than warm-climate stores (23-25%)
- **Urban vs Regional**: Urban stores (Shibuya, Osaka, Shinjuku) skew toward Women's Apparel (28-33%), while regional stores favor Footwear
- **Consistent weekday preference** across all locations, suggesting company-wide customer demographic pattern rather than location-specific variation

**Implication**: Inventory allocation for Q2 spring season should account for these regional preferences, maintaining Footwear focus in northern stores while shifting urban stores toward spring apparel collections.

### Q2: What emerging trends should we capitalize on?

**Answer**: Three key trends emerge from January 2024 data:

1. **Footwear Category Strength** (29.1% revenue share): Winter footwear demand exceeded typical category allocation, suggesting opportunity to expand Footwear SKUs and inventory depth
2. **High-Value Accessories** (¥38,175 avg transaction): Highest transaction value indicates customer willingness to purchase premium accessories, pointing to potential for expanded luxury accessory lines
3. **Weekday Shopping Preference** (77% of revenue): Professional customers shopping during work week represent high-value segment for targeted loyalty programs

**Recommendation**: Launch "Weekday VIP" program targeting business professionals with exclusive access to new arrivals on Monday-Thursday.
