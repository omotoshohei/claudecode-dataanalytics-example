# Project Requirements Document
## Multi-Store Fashion Retail Sales Analysis

**Project Name**: Multi-Store Sales Analysis - January 2024
**Business Type**: Fashion/Apparel Retail Chain
**Date**: October 2025
**Version**: 1.0

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This project aims to analyze sales performance across 10 fashion retail stores located throughout Japan for January 2024. The analysis will provide executive management with actionable insights on seasonal patterns, emerging trends, and regional performance to inform strategic decisions for Q2 2024 and beyond.

---

## 2. Project Background

### Business Context
Our fashion retail chain operates 10 stores across major Japanese cities:
- **Kanto Region**: Shibuya, Shinjuku, Ikebukuro, Yokohama
- **Kansai Region**: Osaka
- **Other Regions**: Sapporo (Hokkaido), Sendai (Tohoku), Nagoya (Chubu), Hiroshima (Chugoku), Fukuoka (Kyushu)

January 2024 represents typical winter season operations with standard inventory and no major promotional events. This analysis will establish a baseline for monthly/quarterly recurring analysis.

### Business Challenge
Executive management needs data-driven insights to:
- Understand how seasonal patterns vary by location and region
- Identify emerging fashion trends across different markets
- Benchmark store performance for best practice sharing
- Guide regional expansion strategy
- Make informed decisions for Q2 2024 planning

2. **Identify emerging trends** in fashion categories and customer preferences
3. **Compare revenue performance** by store and region
4. **Measure year-over-year growth** where historical data permits
5. **Understand customer traffic patterns** across locations and time periods

### Secondary Objectives
1. Establish a **repeatable analysis framework** for monthly/quarterly reporting
2. Create **executive-ready deliverables** suitable for C-level presentation
3. Develop **actionable recommendations** for Q2 2024
4. Enable **store benchmarking** and best practice identification
5. Provide **regional expansion insights** based on market performance

## 8. Assumptions

1. January 2024 data represents typical winter operations (no major events)
2. Data files contain complete transactional records for the month
3. Historical data (January 2023) may be available for YoY comparison
4. Store metadata (location, size, region) can be inferred or defined
5. Product categories can be standardized across stores
6. This analysis framework will be repeated monthly/quarterly
7. Executive audience prefers visual insights over detailed statistical analysis

---

## 9. Constraints

### Data Constraints
- Data limited to January 2024
- Files in mixed formats (Excel and CSV)
- Japanese language text requires UTF-8 encoding
- File naming inconsistent across stores

### Timeline Constraints
- Project to be completed in 4 sequential phases
- Each phase depends on previous phase completion

### Resource Constraints
- Analysis performed using Python/pandas ecosystem
- PDF generation using open-source tools (weasyprint)
- No access to proprietary BI tools

## 10. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Data quality issues (missing values, errors) | High | Comprehensive data validation and cleaning in Phase 2 |
| Inconsistent schemas across store files | Medium | Standardization pipeline in data engineering phase |
| Japanese encoding problems | Medium | UTF-8 handling throughout pipeline |
| Limited historical data for YoY analysis | Low | Focus on cross-store comparison if historical unavailable |
| Insights too generic or not actionable | High | Ground all insights in specific data patterns and regional context |
